        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>
          Fry the finely chopped onions and minced meat in oil. Add the salt and
          pepper. Grease a round baking tray and put a layer of pastry in it.
          Cover with a thin layer of filling and cover this with another layer
          of filo pastry which must be well coated in oil. Put another layer of
          filling and cover with pastry. When you have five or six layers, cover
          with filo pastry, bake at 200ºC/392ºF for half an hour and cut in
          quarters and serve.
